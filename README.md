# EPL Match Outcome Prediction Model  

This was my attempt at building a model to predict English Premier League match outcomes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win). This was a much more complicated task than I first thought. I quickly realized how much feature engineering actually matters and how much information you can unlock if done correctly. I also got to see how effective **AutoML** can be for modelling data as well as, optimizing models without manually tweaking everything.  

## Project Breakdown  

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning  
- Loaded multiple seasons of EPL data.  
- Made sure everything was consistent across datasets.  

### 2. Feature Engineering  
- Built new features based on team form, head-to-head results, goal differences, and other match stats.  

### 3. Model Training & AutoML  
- Tested different machine learning models.  
- Used AutoML to find the best-performing model.  

### 4. Evaluation & Insights  
- Measured performance with accuracy and other metrics.  
- Looked at which features actually mattered in making predictions.  

## Next Steps  
- Improve feature selection.  
- Try other modeling approaches.  
- Maybe bring in real-time betting odds to see if that improves results.
